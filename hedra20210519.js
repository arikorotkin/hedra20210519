/*
A ladder has a certain number of rungs, r.

You can climb the ladder by taking steps that span any number of rungs between 1 and s.
For example, if s is 3, then each step you take on the ladder can increase your position by 1, 2, or 3 rungs.

Write a function, LadderCombinations, that takes in parameters r and s and returns the total number of possible step combinations you can take to climb the ladder.
If there are no ways to climb the ladder, your function should return 1 (there is only 1 way not to climb the ladder).


As an example, if r is 4 and s is 2, then the following constitute the possible step combinations to climb the ladder:
    - [1, 1, 1, 1],
    - [1, 1, 2],
    - [1, 2, 1],
    - [2, 1, 1], and
    - [2, 2].
Therefore, your function should return 5.

0 ≤ r ≤ 20
1 ≤ s ≤ 4

FOR A SIMPLER VERSION OF THIS PROBLEM, ASSUME s IS ALWAYS 3.
